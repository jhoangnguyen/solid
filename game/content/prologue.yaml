      Fynn leads me behind the training grounds, cutting across a canopy of cut, yellow grass. Ahead I see a faded crimson barn, or stables, maybe. She loftly shoves the towering doors open with the ease of a giant’s might.
      “So. What did you want to discuss, squire?” Fynn beckons while undoing the straps around her steel gauntlets. She lifts her knee up and her boot thuds against a crate.
      The corner of my mouth can’t help but begin to do something funny despite the fact that the situation wasn’t very funny at all. I’m seeing her as she was before: A staggeringly brute of a captain. Dirty, blonde hair. Rough hands. A height so towering I’m forced to look at her disrespectfully if I look straight ahead. But it’s certainly strange. Even with the same kind eyes that seem to cradle you everytime you gaze into them, the same gentle pair I’ve been accustomed for most of my life,
      A Fynn without war scars isn’t really Fynn at all. 
      She blinks to look up upon noticing my silence.
      “Is there a problem?”

      “You’re the Captain of the Grinswalde Knights, aren’t you? How come you aren’t out there venturing into the new dungeons that’ve been popping up everywhere? You’re easily worth an entire squadron alone.”
      This was never questioned previously. The assumption of the Horizon as a game made players follow game logic. Quests and missions were for players to complete, never for background characters. There was no wondering why Fynn Baumann, who if ranked in the player’s leaderboard would be top ten, wasn’t venturing out herself.
      “There are roles we each have to play,” Fynn chided. “For you otherworldly adventurers, that’s frolicking around subterranean mana pockets. The Grinswalde Knights have a duty to protect the citizens and the monarch.”
      “C’mon, it wouldn’t spell the doom of the kingdom if their head knight stepped out for less than a day. It’ll be over in a flash. Join me.”
      “Rules are rules squire. If we try stepping outside our obligations, we risk falling forever.”
      I groan. I can’t believe she’s been spamming that quote since all the way back now. There are just one too many memories of being beatdown by Fynn’s fists and hearing her tell me to get back up with that stupid phrase.
